This project runs https://twitter.com/culdesacbot1.

The code may be useful to produce batch satellite images from points for other mapping projects.

To replicate, you will need a credentials file with API keys from Twitter and Google as well as a collection of points.

The point data is from the United States Census and the spatial data is from OpenStreetMaps and Google Maps.
